<h1>What is TRAINING REPO [Gen-1 beta]?</h1>
<p>Let me preface everything by saying, I built this app primarily for myself. I continue to expand it's functionality in my spare time, and it's far from a finished product. I appreciate anyone's interest in this project, and feel free to <strong><em>reach out</em></strong> if you want to get involved.</p>

<p>TR[G1] is new training workout app that is specifically design for your individualization. No false promises on contrived routines; you train how you like and when you like. [G1] is now focused on strength training. Future versions will incorporate cardio and more functional training tactics.</p>

<p>TR[G1] is a repository for you to keep track of your sets and reps and provide you with dashboards and matracies to keep your data easy to access. More fun and accurate than a paper workout log, and much more scientifically relevant data points to use when tracking.</p>

<p>TR[G1] takes your tracking to a more precise level by using physics based logic and calculations to more accurately represent your data. Using the basic calculations of simple machines in physics, we can start to compare apples and oranges; machines and free weights.</p>

<p>TR[G1] is designed for a 'kaizen' approach to training. That through measured KPI's, you'll be able to reliably show a consistant improvement trend. You don't have to break every record, every time to still improve.</p>

<h2>What TRAINING REPO [Gen-1 beta] is NOT?</h2>
<ul>
  <li>TR does not prescribe routines (at least not yet).</li>
  <li>TR does not support silly-science, psudo-science or fad-science which purports to have the one and only key to maxmizing training.</li>
  <li>TR does not pretend to be your only resource for training.</li>
  <li>TR will not change the world.</li>
</ul>
